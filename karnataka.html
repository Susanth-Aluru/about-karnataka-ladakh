                <br> In response to the prayers of the gods and goddesses, the Goddess Parvathi, took birth as Chamundeshwari and killed 
                <br> the monster on top of the hill,Chamundi near Mysore. Hence the hill and the city have the names Chamundi Hill and Mysore respectively. 
                <br> After killing the monster, the Goddess stayed on top of the hill.</p>
            <h2>Festivities</h2>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Mysore has a long history of celebrating Dussehra.The origin of this festival is unknown but historians believe 
                <br> it started in the Vijaynagara empire around 15th century CE.This festival was one of the most important festivals of that time and was called Mahanavami.
                <br> After the fall of the Vijayanagara empire,The Wodeyars continued the tradition initially by Raja Wodeyar I and later by his succesors.Abdur Razzaq, a Persian ambassador, 
                <br> reports the festival of  Dasara during his stay in India, in his book Matla-us-Sadain wa Majma-ul-Bahrain(The Rise of the Two auspicious constellations and the Confluence of the Two Oceans). </p>
            <h2>Exibition and other programmes</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The famed Mysore exhibition held during the Dasara was started by the Maharaja of Mysore, Chamaraja Wodeyar X, in 1880, 
                <br> with the intention of introducing up-to-date innovations and developments to the people of Mysore.The task of holding the exhibition is now 
                <br> entrusted to the Karnataka Exhibition Authority, which was constituted in 1981 to organize the exhibition. The task of conducting the Dasara exhibition was entirely 
                <br> entrusted to the Karnataka Exhibition Authority from 1987.</p>
